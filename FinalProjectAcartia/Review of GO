When preparing for GO Chat gpt gave a suggest in which I chnaged this line 
geneList_UPelevated <- setNames(as.integer(sig_genes1$Group == "Up_Tonsa"), sig_genes1$ExtractGene)
group was orginially ExtraGene


chat gpt gave suggestions on how to change the code and I input them into the script. It apears that this code has chnaged the results of GO 
output

The GO fucntion that chat gave and the fucntion that Alison and I had already made prodcued the same results when common lines were added from chat after the function was executed 

Term is the description 
Annotated is the number of genes in the dataset that are associated with that GO term
signficant is the number of genes in the test (differentially expressed) that are associated with GO terms 
Expected is the exprected number of genes assocated with this Go term based on random distribution  
classicFisher is the p-val from the fisher exact test that assesses wheather the enrichment iof genes in this GO term is sat signifcant lower values indivate stronger signicance 

based on the fischer test alone the data that was generated was not statisically signifcant
